# SurfsUP Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether it is a wise investment for our investor to invest in a Surf and Ice Cream Shop. An analysis of temperature data in Oahu where the shop is planned to be opened in was completed in June and December to determine if the Surf and Ice Cream Shop is a sustainable business year round. 

First, we imported extract from sqlalchemy and extracted all data for the month of June.

This data was then created into a dataframe and descriptive statistics were gathered from all the June weather data.

The same was done to gather all the temperature weather data for Decemeber.

A dataframe was created to hold the temperature data and descriptive statistics were ran.

- On average, June's temperature is 3.902589 degree's higher than December's temperature. 
- December's lowest temperature in the data is 8 degrees lower than June's lowest temperature.
- June's highest temperature in the data is only 2 degrees higher than December's highest temperature. 
## Summary
This data shows a low variance in degrees between June and Decembers' temperature weather data. When it comes to whether the Surf and Ice Cream shop would be a sustainable year-round business, based off of the temperature weather data that we have, it shows that both summer and winter months have average temperatures that would bring in surfers and ice cream connoisseurs year round. 
An important query to run would be looking at the descriptive statistics for the precipitation in June and December. Another important query to run for the weather in June and December would be looking at stations reporting the weather data for Oahu for June and December.
